A Func is a defined [[Delegate]] type in .NET which is similar to an [[Action]] except it returns a value. It is part of the System namespace, it is commonly used for queries, calculations or anything else that could require a return value. Like an [[Action]], it can take 0 or more arguments. The final type parameter (so that could be T in: `Func<T>`, T1 in: `Func<T,T1>`, or T4 in: `Func<T, T1, T2, T3, T4>` for example) is the returned result's type, so a `Func<int, string>` would be a function which takes an int and returns a string.
