A Galois field or finite field is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is set on which the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction and division are defined and satisfy basic rules. 
In the context of the [[Linear Feedback Shift Register]], the field GF(2) is useful, denoting a sort of number system where only 0 and 1 are used, all arithmetic follows modulo-2 rules.
e.g: ($1 \pm 1 = 0$), ($1 \pm 0 = 1$), ($0 \pm 0 = 0$).
