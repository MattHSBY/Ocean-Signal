VHF (Very High Frequency) is the [[ITU]] designation for the range of radio frequency electromagnetic waves (radio waves) from 30 to 300 megahertz (MHz), with corresponding wavelengths of ten meters to one meter. Frequencies immediately below VHF are denoted high frequency (HF), and the next higher frequencies are known as ultra high frequency (UHF).
This is the primary frequency range for the MOB2 for both AIS and DSC messages.
