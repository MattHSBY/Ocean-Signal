Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a spread-spectrum modulation technique primarily used to reduce overall signal interference. The direct-sequence modulation makes the transmitted signal wider in bandwidth than the information bandwidth. After the despreading or removal of the direct-sequence modulation in the receiver, the information bandwidth is restored, while the unintentional and intentional interference is substantially reduced. 

Pseudo-Noise is added to the original data by using a spreading sequence generated by a [[Linear Feedback Shift Register]]. The PN code has higher bitrate, the output is the XOR of each 'chip' (each bit of the PN code) and its respective bit in the original data. In [[T-018]] the beacons use 256 chips per bit.
