A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate the delegate instance with any method that has a compatible signature and return type. You can invoke (or call) the method through the delegate instance.

A delegate is a top-level type, similar to classes, structs, interfaces, etc... Or at least it can be, (in the same way you can have sub-classes, but classes can also be defined outside of any class or other type, and most of the time they are.) This means that its access modifier will be internal or public (again, only if the delegate is defined at a top-level) because private, or protected for example, rely on an implied parent class.

Example:
```C#
// Define a delegate
public delegate int Operation(int x, int y);

// Create methods that match the delegate signature
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    public int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
}

// Use the delegate
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        Operation op = calc.Add;       // Assign method to delegate
        Console.WriteLine(op(3, 4));   // Outputs: 7

        op = calc.Multiply;            // Reassign to another method
        Console.WriteLine(op(3, 4));   // Outputs: 12
    }
}
```
As seen in the example, the method is stored in the variable Operation, it's basically a type for a method, so (as long as the delegates return type and parameters match) it can store a method as a variable whose type is that delegate.
