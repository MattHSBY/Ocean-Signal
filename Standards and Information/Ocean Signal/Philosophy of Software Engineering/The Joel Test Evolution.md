In August 2000, [Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky)  of [Fog Creek Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch,_Inc.) created "The Joel Test" in his seminal blog [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) as a quick and ready way of evaluating a company's software development practices. It was a good test back then, but software engineering practices have changed a lot in the intervening 25 years. If the Joel Test were updated to the current day, what might the twelve tests be?

I present: _The Joel Test Evolution: A modern take on measuring a company’s software engineering practices for today’s challenges_.

## 1. Modern Version Control and Collaborative Code Reviews
Do you use a distributed version control system (like Git) paired with robust code review processes (pull/merge requests, automated linters, and static analysis) to ensure collective code ownership and early defect detection?
## 2. Fully Automated CI/CD Pipeline
Can you build, test, and deploy your software automatically with a single command or commit? Modern pipelines should trigger comprehensive automated test suites and deploy to staging (and even production) with minimal manual intervention.
## 3. Comprehensive Automated Testing
Is your code under the protection of layered test suites—including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests—that run on every commit, with test coverage metrics to verify that new changes don’t break core functionality?
## 4. Agile Issue Tracking and Transparent Workflows
Do you use a digital, integrated issue-tracking system (like JIRA, GitHub Issues, or Azure DevOps) that syncs seamlessly with your version control and supports agile planning, backlog grooming, and sprint reviews for continuous improvement?
## 5. Incremental, Frequent, and Safe Releases
Are you leveraging continuous delivery/deployment practices (with canary releases, blue-green deployments, or feature flagging) to ensure that small batches of changes are pushed frequently, monitored closely, and reversible if needed?
## 6. Infrastructure as Code and DevOps Culture
Is your production environment provisioned and managed as code (using tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, or Ansible) so that deployments are repeatable, scalable, and integrated with your development practices, fostering a true DevOps culture?
## 7. Built-In Security and Automated Vulnerability Scanning
Do you integrate security into your development process by running automated static and dynamic analysis, regularly scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities, and conducting periodic security audits as part of your CI/CD pipeline?
## 8. End-to-End Monitoring and Observability
Are you equipped with tools that provide real-time application monitoring, logging, and alerting as well as proactive observability practices, so that you can pinpoint and resolve issues before they affect users?
## 9. Remote-First Collaboration and Developer Ergonomics
Do your developers operate in environments—whether distributed or on-site—that provide not only quiet, focused workspaces but also robust tools for asynchronous communication, collaboration, and cross-time-zone coordination?
## 10. Culture of Continuous Learning and Technical Excellence
Do you foster an environment where experimentation, knowledge sharing (via tech talks, pair programming, or postmortems), and ongoing learning are not only encouraged but structurally supported, ensuring your team stays on the cutting edge?
## 11. Realistic, Hands-On Candidate Evaluation
Does your hiring process include practical coding challenges, pair-programming sessions, or real-world technical tasks that mimic actual work scenarios, ensuring that new hires can excel in a modern development environment?
## 12. Data-Driven Feedback and Adaptive Process Improvements
Do you regularly collect and analyze production and process metrics—from user-reported issues to automated performance dashboards—and use these insights in retrospectives to refine your workflows, development practices, and team dynamics?

These tests aim to evaluate whether a company is truly embracing a holistic modern approach to software engineering that values automation, transparency, continuous improvement, and collaboration.
