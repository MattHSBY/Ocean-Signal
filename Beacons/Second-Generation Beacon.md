The Second-Generation Beacon (SGB) is an upgraded version of emergency distress beacons used in search and rescue (SAR) operations. These beacons transmit distress signals to satellites, helping locate people in emergencies, such as aircraft crashes or maritime disasters.

## What differentiates an SGB from a pre-existing beacon?
- SGBs provide location accuracy within 100 meters, which is significantly more accurate than the 5km + of older beacons.
- Higher location accuracy means less time searching for a victim in areas such as canyons, caves and the open ocean.
- SGBs utilise [[Bodies/International/European Union/Galileo.md|Galileo]]'s [[Return Link Service|Return Link Service (RLS)]] meaning a victim's beacon will receive a response confirming help is on the way.
- SGBs have a more spread spectrum mitigating the chance of interference to a higher degree.
