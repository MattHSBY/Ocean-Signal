Return Link Service (RLS) is a free-of-charge global service available to [[COSPAS-SARSAT]] RLS compatible beacons. It was declared operational at the 12th European Space Conference, which took place in the Egmont Palace in Brussels on the 21st of January. RLS' unique functionality enables a communication link that relays Return Link Messages (RLM) back to the originating beacon through the Galileo Navigational Signal in Space.

“Anyone in trouble will now receive solid confirmation, through an indication on their activated beacon, informing them that search and rescue services have been informed of their alert and location,” explains ESA’s Galileo principal search and rescue engineer Igor Stojkovic. “For anyone in a tough situation, such knowledge could make a big difference.”
