The stack is a region of memory that stores [[Value Type]]s, method call [[StackFrame]]s and local variables. It operates in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) manner - meaning the last item pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.

It might be important to note that every object directly stored by the stack is a [[StackFrame]], however, [[Value Type]] variables which are stored in stack memory are stored inside each [[StackFrame]] as that [[StackFrame]]'s local variables.
