Binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is a type of [[Phase shift keying]], it is the simplest form of [[Phase shift keying|PSK]], it uses two phases which are seperated by 180Â° and so can also be termed 2-PSK. It does not particularly matter exactly where the constellation points are positioned. It is the most robust of all [[Phase shift keying|PSK]]s, however it is only able to modulate at 1 bit per symbol and so is unsuitable for high data-rate applications.
