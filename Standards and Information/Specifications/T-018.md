## Introduction

This specification defines the minimum requirements to be used for the development and manufacture of Second Generation 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs), Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons ([[EPIRBs]]), and Personal Locator Beacons ([[PLBs]]).  
### Types of Beacon
There are 4 different types of [[COSPAS-SARSAT]] 406 MHz beacons; Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs), Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons ([[EPIRBs]]), Personal Locator Beacons ([[PLBs]]) and Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) Beacons. This standard does not address requirements for Second Generation SSAS Beacons.
Each type of beacon can be supplied with a Class 0, Class 1, or Class 2 operating temperature.
Class 0: -55°C -> 70°C
Class 1: -40°C -> 55°C
Class 2: -20°C -> 55°C

#### ELTs
[[ELT]]s (Emergency Locator Transmitters) are designed for aviation distress purposes and are available as the following types: Automatic Fixed ([[ELT]] (AF)), Automatic Portable ([[ELT]] (AP)), Survival ([[ELT]] (S)), Automatic Deployable ([[ELT]] (AD)), and Distress Tracking [[ELT]] ([[ELT]] (DT)).


#### EPIRBs
[[Beacons/EPIRBs/EPIRB.md|EPIRBS]] are designed for maritime distress purposes and are available as Float free and Non Float free types of [[EPIRB]].

**Float Free EPIRB**
This type of [[EPIRB]] is intended to float free of the vessel on which it is fitted if the vessel sinks, in which case it will automatically activate, it can also be manually activated.

**Non Float Free EPIRB**
This type of [[EPIRB]] is intended to be manually released from its mounting bracket and then either manually activated or dropped in the water so that it will then activate automatically. Some national administrations permit the use of manually activated [[EPIRB]]s only without the automatic activation in water feature.


#### PLBs
[[PLB]]s (Personal Locator Beacons) are designed for use by persons in distress who may be on land, in the air or at sea.


### Optional Features
Beacons may contain optional features that are defined in this specification.
Encoded Location capability is optional, however in the case of [[ELT]] (DT) devices intended for in-flight automatic activation the inclusion of a [[GNSS]] capability is mandatory.
All types of beacons (except currently [[Beacons/ELTs/ELT.md|ELT]](DT)s) may also be provided with the Return Link Service capability.
All types of beacons may be provided with one or more additional radio-locating transmitters for Homing and On-scene Locating purposes.
### Additional Features
Beacons may contain additional functionality that may change the transmitted 406 MHz satellite signal or affect other beacon parameters such as operating lifetime. For example, a beacon may contain a flashing strobe light that while it probably has no effect on the transmitted signal, would reduce the battery life.
Any additional functionality that is not defined in this specification shall not adversely degrade the performance of the beacon to the extent that it no longer complies with this specification.

## Technical Requirements
### 


## Digital Message Content
### Basic Structure
The digital message which is transmitted by the 406 MHz beacon consists of:
- 202 information bits
- 48 bits for BCH (250, 202) error correction.

The 202 information bits are further divided into: 
- 154 bits within the main data field (transmitted in every burst),
- 48 bits within a rotating data field (may be 1 of 16 different content types).

Data transmission starts with bit 1, the left-hand (most significant) bit of the 154 bit main field.

### Beacon Message Content - Main Field
The main field provides for the minimum requirements of document C/S G.008 using sub-fields. Unless stated otherwise all sub-fields are separately binary encoded, with the Least Significant Bit to the right (i.e. the highest numbered bit in that particular message field).
### Beacon Message Content - Rotating Fields
The objective requirements of document C/S G.008 are provided in rotating fields as detailed below. During every transmission burst the beacon shall transmit 1 of the 16 types of rotating field content. The type of field content selected for transmission shall be in accordance with the rotating field scheduling requirements. The 16 types of rotating field content are listed below.
### Beacon Coding and Hex ID
The manufacturer shall program a unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number into every beacon before it leaves their factory. The TAC Number and Serial Number shall not be capable of being deleted from that beacon. Only approved devices shall be allowed to temporarily modify the TAC and Serial Number in the transmitted message (e.g., a programming adapter. If a unit is destroyed or recycled at the end of its life, the unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number used in that beacon shall not be used in another beacon.

The 23 hexadecimal characters that uniquely identify each 406 MHz beacon are called the beacon 23 Hex ID. This is never transmitted by the beacon as such, rather it is generated locally by the SAR ground segment hardware and generated during beacon manufacture in order to apply identity labels to the beacon by extracting the bits shown below from the beacon data.

The 23 Hex ID is composed as follows:

### Programming Adapters
If a manufacturer chooses to offer an optional Programming Adapter with a particular Beacon Model (as defined in C/S T.021 section 1.3) then it shall comply with the requirements in this section.

A Programming Adapter shall only be capable of functioning with one particular Beacon Model; separate Beacon Models shall require the use of a different Programming Adapter. The mechanism used to prevent the use of a Programming Adapter with a model for which it was not designed shall be defined by the beacon manufacturer and may include physically keying of the adaptors, use of model recognition functionality, or other suitable design features. 
Each Programming Adapter shall be given its own unique Serial Number by the beacon manufacturer. 

The manufacturer shall program a unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number into every Programming Adapter before it leaves their factory. The TAC Number and Serial Number shall not be capable of being deleted from that Programming Adapter or being overwritten by any means. If a unit is destroyed or recycled at the end of its life, the unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number used in that Programming Adapter shall not be used in another Programming Adapter. 

All data stored in a Programming Adapter shall be in non-volatile memory.

A Programming Adapter shall be capable of having a Country Code and Vessel ID programmed into it, which may be capable of being changed and overwritten.

When a beacon connected to a Programming Adapter is activated, it shall continue to transmit in its message the ID supplied from the Programming Adapter for the duration of the beacon activation, even if the adapter subsequently becomes disconnected/disassociated from the beacon. When next activated (unless the Programming Adapter or another Programming Adapter has been reconnected / connected to the beacon in the meantime), it shall transmit the beacon’s own unique TAC Number and Serial Number and the Country Code and Vessel ID. If a Programming Adapter is connected to an activated beacon, then the beacon shall ignore the Programming Adapter and continue to transmit the beacons own identity, until the beacon is deactivated and subsequently reactivated with the Programming Adapter connected, at which time it will then transmit the identity in the Programming Adapter.
## Environmental and Operational Requirements
### General
SGBs shall function with the [[MEOSAR]] system such that 406 MHz transmissions from a beacon can be correctly detected, located, and decoded by a MEOLUT when the beacon is operated in nominal beacon configuration
### Thermal Environment
#### Operating Temperature Range
Three standard classes of operating temperature range are defined, inside which all of the requirements within this specification shall be met:
- Class 0: -55°C -> 70°C
- Class 1: -40°C -> 55°C
- Class 2: -20°C -> 55°C

#### Temperature Gradient
The beacon needs to be subjected to this temperature gradient and produce all the same results according to every part of this specification before it can meet the requirements of this specification.
![[Pasted image 20250225142025.png]]

#### Thermal Shock
All of the requirements within this specification shall be met, for measurements beginning 5 seconds after simultaneously activating the beacon and applying a rapid thermal shock of 50°C within the specified operating temperature range of the beacon within 1 minute. Subsequently, all requirements shall continue to be met for a minimum period of 2 hours.

#### Mechanical Environment 
Beacons should be submitted to vibration and shock tests consistent with their intended use. These requirements should be defined by national authorities, preferably using internationally recognised standards such as RTCA/DO-204 for ELTs.

#### Other Environmental Requirements
Other environmental requirements such as humidity tests, altitude tests, over/under pressure tests, waterproofness tests, sand and dust tests, fluids susceptibility tests, etc., may be defined by national authorities, preferably using internationally-recognised standards.

#### Operational Requirements 
##### Duration of Continuous Operation
The minimum duration of continuous operation shall be at least 24 hours* at any temperature throughout the specified operating temperature range.

For ELT(DT)s, at the end of the 370-minute period, the ELT(DT) shall continue transmitting on the same schedule as before the 370-minute limit was reached until the ELT(DT) is either deactivated, or runs out of battery life.
