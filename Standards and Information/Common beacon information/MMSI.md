MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) is effectively a maritime object's international maritime telephone number, a temporarily assigned UID issued by that object's current flag state. An MMSI comprises a series of nine digits, consisting of three Maritime Identification Digits (normally country-codes), concatenated with a specific identifier. Whenever an object is re-flagged, a new MMSI must be assigned.

Think of this as a unique identifier for any ship, although since [[MOB2]]s are not part of any ship, they have their own unique MMSIs, which start with 972 irrespective of which country they were manufactured/are used in.
