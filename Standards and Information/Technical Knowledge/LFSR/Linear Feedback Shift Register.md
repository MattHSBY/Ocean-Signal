A Linear Feedback Shift Register ([[Standards and Information/Technical Knowledge/LFSR/Linear Feedback Shift Register.md|LFSR]]) is a digital circuit whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. This means a binary number is used as an input, then numbers are generated pseudo-randomly based on (usually) the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.
The initial value of the [[Standards and Information/Technical Knowledge/LFSR/Linear Feedback Shift Register.md|LFSR]] is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, this means the results are reproducible and repeatable if the same seed is used. 

## Maximal-length
A maximal-length [[Standards and Information/Technical Knowledge/LFSR/Linear Feedback Shift Register.md|LFSR]] will generate a [[Maximum length sequence]], which means that the [[Standards and Information/Technical Knowledge/LFSR/Linear Feedback Shift Register.md|LFSR]] will generate the longest possible sequence before repeating.
An [[Standards and Information/Technical Knowledge/LFSR/Linear Feedback Shift Register.md|LFSR]] is maximal-length if and only if the corresponding [[Standards and Information/Technical Knowledge/LFSR/Feedback Polynomial.md|feedback polynomial]] is primitive over the [[Galois Field]] GF(2). In order to be "primitive", the feedback polynomial must have an even number of '[[Tap]]s' (positions where feedback is applied). Also, the set of taps must be "setwise co-prime" meaning that the highest common factor between them must be 1. (e.g 6, 7, 10, 15).
