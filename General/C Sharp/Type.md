Type is defined by the `System.Type` class, which is part of the .NET type system. It represents type declarations for all types of values in C#. This class is essential for C#. To declare a variable in C#, you declare its type, for example:

```C#
string x = "Hello World!"
```
In this example, `string` is the type.
